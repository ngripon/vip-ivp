# Feature List

## Main feature

The package allow to create and solve hybrid ODE systems with initial conditions.
Systems are created with a simple syntax. Moreover, all the features of the Python 
ecosystem is accessible.

The hybrid solver handles:

- Continuous signals
- Discrete signals
- Continuous events with crossing detection

## System definition
### Temporal variables
All the variables used in the system are temporal variables objects.

## Solving

## Post-processing
