# Introducing the Documentation Site for `vip-ivp`

I'm excited to share that the official documentation site for **`vip-ivp`** is now live!

<!-- truncate -->

[`vip-ivp`](https://pypi.org/project/vip-ivp/) is a Python library designed to help you model and solve initial value problems (IVPs) using a modular approach. Itâ€™s a tool I built to simplify the creation of complex dynamic systems â€” especially for engineers, physicists, and researchers who want clarity without sacrificing power.

The new documentation site includes:

* ðŸ“˜ **Getting started guide**
* ðŸ”§ **Installation instructions and usage examples**
* ðŸ§  **Explanations of the core concepts behind the library**
* ðŸ§ª **API reference with practical code snippets**

Whether you're curious about the motivation behind `vip-ivp`, or you're ready to dive into modeling your first system, this site is here to help.

As always, this project is open source and evolving. Iâ€™d love your feedback, questions, or contributions.

Thanks for following along!
